Welcome on your new static website!

This page's content comes from the file in `_pages/index.md`. Its template uses the `[posts]` array to index your blog posts contained in the `_posts` directory.

Well, this is yours now, feel free to modify it! If it's your first time using Miranda, I suggest you to read the [Miranda 101](/blog/miranda-101.html) blog post :grin:
